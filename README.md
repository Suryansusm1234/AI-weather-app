🧠 How It Works
User enters a city name and submits the form. The app makes requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather and forecast data. If valid data is returned, the UI updates to display:

City and country name
Temperature (°C or °F)
Weather condition and matching icon
Humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
Local time and date
AI-generated outfit suggestions tailored to the weather
If the API returns an error (e.g., invalid city), a user-friendly error message is shown. The app is fully responsive and adapts to all screen sizes including mobile devices.

⚠️ Known Issues / Future Improvements
